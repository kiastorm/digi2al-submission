## Running the code

> I'm using `go version go1.22.5 darwin/arm64`.

1. `go run main.go` to run the code.

## What else would I do?

- Incorporate the learnings found here https://technology.blog.gov.uk/2021/04/19/simple-things-are-complicated-making-a-show-password-option/
  - More specifically, I would announce the change of state to screen readers when toggling between show/hide
- Documentation, tests, better organisation etc.

Hope you like it!
